        <h3><a href="gathering"></a>A) GATHERING OF INFORMATION BY HUNDRED ACRES</h3>
        <p>Once you access the Site, an exchange of information automatically takes place, without any intervention on your part, between your computer and Hundred Acres&apos; servers. This exchange of information does not allow Hundred Acres to personally identify you. However, this exchange does allow Hundred Acres to obtain information such as: i) the Internet domain that you have used to access the Site; ii) your IP address (IP means Internet Protocol, a unique number assigned to your computer when it is connected to the Internet and makes it possible to transmit documents to you without any errors); iii) the type of browser and operating system used to access the Site; iv) the date and time you accessed the Site; v) the Web pages that you visited; and vi) the address of the Website from which you accessed the Site, if applicable.</p>
        <p>The information is gathered using cookies that the Site may automatically collect. Those cookies are pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer&apos;s hard disk. Cookies are used mainly to simplify visitors&apos; browsing experience by “remembering” their language preference. You may choose to configure your browser in order to be notified that you are receiving a cookie or to prevent such cookies from being sent. However, so that you may access and use the Site, your browser must be set to accept cookie files. It is also possible to delete cookie files from your computer after visiting the Site.</p>
        <h3>B) COLLECTED INFORMATION AND HOW IT IS USED</h3>
        <p>All collected information is mainly used by Hundred Acres to track the number of visitors to the Site and its different pages, the average time that visitors spend on the Site and to provide useful statistics that will serve in particular to enhance the Site.</p>
        <p>Hundred Acres does not collect any of your personal information unless you have voluntarily decided, at your sole discretion, to provide such information.</p>
        <p>Correspondingly, to follow up on your requests for reservations, services or purchase orders, we need your name, email address and addresses where we will send your reservation confirmations or deliver your purchases of tourist products or services, if applicable. We may therefore process and follow up on your requests while strictly complying with our security procedures. We also request your telephone numbers in order to promptly reach you in case of a problem relating to the contents of your requests or their delivery.</p>
        <p>The site allows you to create a user profile so you can save time when making reservations or purchases. It also makes it possible for us to contact you directly by e-mail or phone with information that might interest you, such as newsletters (Sépaq.com Keeps You Informed”, “Sports Hunting”), infoletters (“Hundred Acres Special”, “Local”), and invitations. Your personal information is also utilized to create your profile (including the modification of your profile parameters and the deletion of your profile) to make it easier for us to share relevant information with you, and to help us get a better understanding of our user profiles. At any time, you can decide which information you would like to receive or refuse. Your profile information is strictly confidential and will not be used for any reasons other than those described in the Policy.</p>
        <p>All of this information is also required if you wish to enter one of our contests, be notified of an exceptional promotion, subscribe to Hundred Acres&apos; newsletters or register on our mailing list or complete surveys.</p>
        <p>We also use collected information to enhance the presentation and organization of our products and services, to notify you of any changes and new services that you will find on our Site as well as to advertise any special offer that might appeal to you.</p>
        <h3><a id="conservation">C) CONSERVATION OF INFORMATIONS BY HUNDRED ACRES</a></h3>
        <p>This information is kept on Hundred Acres&apos; secure servers, located in Québec City, Canada. To avoid any unauthorized access, we apply strict security measures when it comes to archiving and disclosing the information that you sent us. You may access your personal information and notify Hundred Acres of any information that you wish to update and request to modify or delete some of the information that Hundred Acres had collected during your visit, by sending an email to conditionsweb@hundredacres.com, or if you have a user&apos;s profile, you may view and update your personal information online after logging in to your account. You may also choose, at any time, to contact Hundred Acres&apos; Customer Service. After closing your profile, you may no longer log in to our Site or access your personal information. However, you may create a new profile on our Site.</p>
        <p>Personal, electronic or other information collected by Hundred Acres is not disclosed to anyone, except Hundred Acres&apos; representatives or employees who need this information to perform a duty relating to the fulfillment of the purposes set out in this Policy. You agree and acknowledge that Hundred Acres is also authorized to use, disclose or transmit your personal information to the extent provided or required by law, including court orders, in accordance with the Act Respecting Access to Documents Held by Public Bodies and the Protection of Personal Information(L.R.Q., c. A-2.1).</p>
        <p>Although we take appropriate security measures as required by law, no measure is completely secure. You must always be careful when you handle and disclose personal information and avoid transmitting personal information through insecure email.
        </p>
        <h3><a id="more">D) FOR MORE INFORMATION</a></h3>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this Policy or our information handling practices or if you wish to access, update or correct your personal information, you may contact us by email or by mail at the following address:</p><br>
        <p>Hundred Acre Woods Nature Park<br>123 Groove St., Brownville<br>+44 7911 123456</p>

        <h2><a id="transaction">6. TRANSACTION SECURITY</a></h2>
        <p>Hundred Acres uses advanced technology and equipment to secure online transactions.</p>
        <p>In order to allow you to use Hundred Acres&apos; Website in a secure manner, your computer must be equipped with a Web browser that uses the 128-bit SSL encryption protocol.</p>
        <p>We recommend that you use the following browsers (be sure you have the most recent and updated version):</p>
        <p>Microsoft® Internet Explorer (128 bits)</p>
        <p>Mozilla Firefox (128 bits)</p>
        <p>Hundred Acres guarantees total security of your payments by credit card using data encypherment and SSL secure payment standards. At the time of the transmission of payments, this protocol converts your information into a figure code that is impossible to read (128-bit encryption). Your information is therefore coded and later converted back into intelligible information at the receiving end of the transmission. Coding consists in converting a clearly worded text into unintelligible text (cryptogram), using cryptographic techniques such as algorithms and keys. A secret key is required to decode the information and be able to read a coded page or transaction.</p>
